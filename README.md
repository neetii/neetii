## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Neeti!

Sophomore at The University of Texas at Dallas, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in **Computer Science**

## More about me
I have just begun my journey into learning how to tackle real-world problems using Machine Learning and AI as a fellow of Cornell University's Break Through Tech AI year-long program. I have completed the ML course at Break Through Tech, and I have had so much fun learning a large range of ML algorithms and models, such as Logistive/Linear regression, decision trees, gradient boosting (GBDT), and neural networks. I am currently seeking internships to apply what I have learned from this program thus far and learn from industry professionals.
